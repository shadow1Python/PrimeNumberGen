# PrimeNumberGen
Calculate a set amount of prime numbers between two set integers via randomness.

Note: You can change the variable max and variable min for the two integers tho it isn't recommended as you'll need to change the randomization code and while loop likely.

Note 2: It's a console java app so you'll be asked to provide how many prime numbers to generate, the code will then generate random numbers, if it's prime then the check is passed and it'll repeat until the set number of primes is acheived.

Note 3: After testing there seems to be a 4% chance of getting a prime number.
